## Pair Programing

## What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?

1. Greater efficiency
2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness

## In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?

Greater efficiency:

In reality, when two people focus on the same code base, it is easier to catch mistakes in the making. Research indicates that pair programing takes slightly longer, but produces higher-quality code that doesn’t require later effort in troubleshooting and debugging (let alone exposing users to a broken product).

## How does pair programming work?

 developers explain out loud what the code should do, listen to others’ guidance, read code that others have written, and write code themselves.
