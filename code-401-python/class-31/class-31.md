# Component-Based Architecture

**Component-based architecture focuses on the decomposition of the design into individual functional or logical components that represent well-defined communication interfaces containing methods, events, and properties. It provides a higher level of abstraction and divides the problem into sub-problems, each associated with component partitions.**

- component-based architecture is to ensure component reusability.

## Component-oriented software design has many advantages 

### Reduced time in market and the development cost by reusing existing components.

### Increased reliability with the reuse of the existing components.

## What is a Component?

### A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface.

## Views of a Component: have three different views 

- ### Object-oriented view:

#### A component is viewed as a set of one or more cooperating classes. Each problem domain class (analysis) and infrastructure class (design) are explained to identify all attributes and operations that apply to its implementation. 

- ### Conventional view:

#### It is viewed as a functional element or a module of a program that integrates the processing logic, the internal data structures that are required to implement the processing logic and an interface that enables the component to be invoked and data to be passed to it.

- ### Process-related view

- A user interface (UI) component includes grids.
- Other common types of components are those that are resource intensive, not frequently accesse.
- Many components are invisible which are distributed in enterprise business applications and internet web applications such as Enterprise JavaBean (EJB)

### Characteristics of Components

- Reusability − Components are usually designed to be reused in different situations in different applications. However, some components may be designed for a specific task.

- Replaceable − Components may be freely substituted with other similar components.

- Not context specific − Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts.

- Extensible − A component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.

- Encapsulated − A A component depicts the interfaces, which allow the caller to use its functionality, and do not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.

- Independent − Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.

### Advantages

- Ease of deployment −

- Reduced cost 

- Ease of development − Components implement well-known interfaces to provide defined functionality, allowing development without impacting other parts of the system.

- Reusable − The use of reusable components means that they can be used to spread the development and maintenance cost across several applications or systems.

- Modification of technical complexity 

- Reliability − The overall system reliability increases since the reliability of each individual component enhances the reliability of the whole system via reuse.

- System maintenance and evolution − 

- Independent − Independency and flexible connectivity of components. Independent development of components by different group in parallel. Productivity for the software development and future software development.
