# What is Next Js ?

## Next.js is a flexible React framework that gives you building blocks to create fast web applications.

## Building Blocks of a Web Application

**There are a few things you need to consider when building modern applications. Such as:**

- User Interface - how users will consume and interact with your application.

- Routing - how users navigate between different parts of your application.

- Data Fetching - where your data lives and how to get it.
Rendering - when and where you render static or dynamic content.

- Integrations - what third-party services you use (CMS, auth, payments, etc) and how you connect to them.

- Infrastructure - where you deploy, store, and run your application code (Serverless, CDN, Edge, etc).

- Performance - how to optimize your application for end-users.

- Scalability - how your application adapts as your team, data, and traffic grow.

- Developer Experience - your team’s experience building and maintaining your application.

**You can use React to build your UI, then incrementally adopt Next.js features to solve common application requirements such as routing, data fetching, integrations - all while improving the developer and end-user experience.**

## Utility-First Fundamentals

- With Tailwind, you style elements by applying pre-existing classes directly in your HTML.

- **Using utility classes to build custom designs without writing CSS**

- **This approach allows us to implement a completely custom component design without writing a single line of custom CSS.**

### important benefits:

- You aren’t wasting energy inventing class names.

- Your CSS stops growing. Using a traditional approach, your CSS files get bigger every time you add a new feature. 

- Making changes feels safer

## Why not just use inline styles?

**it is — you’re applying styles directly to elements instead of assigning them a class name and then styling that class.**

### important advantages over inline styles

- Designing with constraints. Using inline styles, every value is a magic number. 

- Responsive design. You can’t use media queries in inline styles, but you can use Tailwind’s responsive utilities to 
build fully responsive interfaces easily.

- Hover, focus, and other states.
