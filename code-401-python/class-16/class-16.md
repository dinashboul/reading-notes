# Encryption, decryption, and cracking

## One of the earliest encryption techniques is the Caesar Cipher

**The Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher which replaces each original letter with a different letter in the alphabet by shifting the alphabet by a certain amount.**

### Decrypting a message

**According to historical records, Caesar always used a shift of 3. As long as his message recipient knew the shift amount, it was trivial for them to decode the message.**

### Cracking the cipher

**crack" the cipher without knowing the shift.**

### There are three main techniques he could use: frequency analysis, known plaintext, and brute force.
