# A Beginner's Guide to Docker

**Docker which is a way to isolate and run entire applications.**

## Linux Containers

**Docker is really just Linux containers which are a type of virtualization.**

### How could multiple programmers use the same single machine?

 **The answer was virtualization and specifically virtual machines which are complete copies of a computer system from the operating system on up.**

### What’s the downside to a virtual machine? 

**Size and speed**

### Most computers rely on the same Linux operating system, so what if we virtualized from that level up instead? Wouldn’t that provide a lightweight, faster way to duplicate much of the same functionality?

**The answer is yes. And in recent years Linux containers, also known as “containerization,” has become increasingly popular. For most applications, a virtual machine provides far more resources than are needed and a container is more than sufficient.**

**NOTE**

**Docker containers are like apartments: they share common infrastructure like plumbing and heating, but come in various sizes that match the exact needs of an owner.**

### Containers vs Virtual Environments

**Virtual environments are used to isolate Python software packages locally. We can create an isolated box for individual projects so one can use Python 2.7 and Django 1.5 while another can use Python 3.5 and Django 2.1 on the same computer. Virtual environments are great.**


### Library Website

**Django REST Framework works alongside the Django web framework to create web APIs.**

### differences between traditional Django and Django REST Framework:

**he most important takeaway is that Django creates websites containing webpages, while Django REST Framework creates web APIs which are a collection of URL endpoints containing available HTTP verbs that return JSON.**

### Traditional Django

**A traditional Django website consists of a single project with multiple apps representing discrete functionality.**
