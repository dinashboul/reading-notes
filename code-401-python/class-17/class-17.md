# Python Regular Expression Tutorial

**regex, are a sequence of characters used to check whether a pattern exists in a given text (string) or not.**

**sed for parsing text data files to find, replace, or delete certain string, etc. They help in manipulating textual data, which is often a prerequisite for data science projects involving text mining.**

### re library, such as: compile(), search(), findall(), sub() for search and replace, split()

## shutil — High-level File Operations

**The shutil module includes high-level file operations such as copying and archiving.**

### Working With Directory Trees

**shutil includes three functions for working with directory trees. To copy a directory from one place to another, use copytree(). It recurses through the source directory tree, copying files to the destination. The destination directory must not exist in advance.**

### Finding Files

**The which() function scans a search path looking for a named file. The typical use case is to find an executable program on the shell’s search path defined in the environment variable PATH.**

### Archives

**Python’s standard library includes many modules for managing archive files such as tarfile and zipfile. There are also several higher-level functions for creating and extracting archives in shutil.**

### File System Space

**It can be useful to examine the local file system to see how much space is available before performing a long running operation that may exhaust that space. disk_usage() returns a tuple with the total space, the amount currently being used, and the amount remaining free.**

### Watchdog

**Python API library and shell utilities to monitor file system events.**

### Directory monitoring made easy with

- A cross-platform API.
- A shell tool to run commands in response to directory changes.
