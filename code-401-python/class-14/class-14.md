# Web Scraping

**web harvesting, or web data extraction is data scraping used for extracting data from websites.**

## Important notes about web scraping:

- Read through the website’s Terms and Conditions to understand how you can legally use the data

- Make sure you are not downloading data at too rapid a rate because this may break the website.

### Techniques:

**Web scraping is the process of automatically mining data or collecting information from the World Wide Web. It is a field with active developments sharing a common goal with the semantic web vision**

- Human copy-and-paste

- Text pattern matching

- HTTP programming

- HTML parsing

- DOM parsing

- Vertical aggregation

- Semantic annotation recognizing

- Computer vision web-page analysis

### Methods to prevent web scraping

- Blocking an IP address either manually or based on criteria

- Disabling any web service API that the website's system might expose.

- Bots sometimes declare who they are (using user agent strings) and can be blocked on that basis using robots.txt; 'googlebot' is an example. 

- Bots can be blocked by monitoring excess traffic

- Bots can sometimes be blocked with tools to verify that it is a real person accessing the site, like a CAPTCHA. 

- Commercial anti-bot services: Companies offer anti-bot and anti-scraping services for websites

- Locating bots with a honeypot or other method to identify the IP addresses of automated crawlers.

### a few easy giveaways that you are bot/scraper/crawler 

- Scraping too fast and too many pages, faster than a human ever can

- Following the same pattern while crawling.

- Too many requests from the same IP address in a very short time

- Not identifying as a popular browser. You can do this by specifying a ‘User-Agent’.

- using a user agent string of a very old browser
