# JupyterLab 

## JupyterLab is a next-generation web-based user interface for Project Jupyter.

### **JupyterLab enables you to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner.**

- Code Consoles provide transient scratchpads for running code interactively, with full support for rich output. A code console can be linked to a notebook kernel as a computation log from the notebook, for example.

- Kernel-backed documents enable code in any text file (Markdown, Python, R, LaTeX, etc.) to be run interactively in any Jupyter kernel.

- Notebook cell outputs can be mirrored into their own tab, side by side with the notebook, enabling simple dashboards with interactive controls backed by a kernel.

- Multiple views of documents with different editors or viewers enable live editing of documents reflected in other viewers. For example, it is easy to have live preview of Markdown, Delimiter-separated Values, or Vega/Vega-Lite documents.

#### JupyterLab Releases

#####  the releases of JupyterLab are suitable for general daily use by both Jupyter novices and users experienced with the Classic Notebook interface

## NumPy Tutorial: Data Analysis with Python

#### **NumPy is a commonly used Python data analysis package. By using NumPy, you can speed up your workflow, and interface with other packages in the Python ecosystem, like scikit-learn, that use NumPy under the hood.**

#### Lists Of Lists for CSV Data

**We can read in the file using the csv.reader object, which will allow us to read in and split up all the content from the ssv file.**

#### Numpy 2-Dimensional Arrays

**NumPy, we work with multidimensional arrays. We’ll dive into all of the possible types of multidimensional arrays later on, but for now, we’ll focus on 2-dimensional arrays**
