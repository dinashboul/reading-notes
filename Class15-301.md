# What is OAuth?

## What is OAuth?

OAuth is an open-standard authorization protocol or framework that describes how unrelated servers and services can safely allow authenticated access to their assets without actually sharing the initial, related, single logon credential

## Give an example of what using OAuth would look like.

log onto a website and it offers one or more opportunities to log on using another website’s/service’s logon. 


## How does OAuth work? What are the steps that it takes to authenticate the user?
 
 Let’s assume a user has already signed into one website or service (OAuth only works using HTTPS). The user then initiates a feature/transaction that needs to access another unrelated site or service. 

 ### The first website connects to the second website on behalf of the user, using OAuth, providing the user’s verified identity.

### The second site generates a one-time token and a one-time secret unique to the transaction and parties involved.

### The first site gives this token and secret to the initiating user’s client software.

### The client’s software presents the request token and secret to their authorization provider (which may or may not be the second site).

### If not already authenticated to the authorization provider, the client may be asked to authenticate. After authentication, the client is asked to approve the authorization transaction to the second website.

### The user approves (or their software silently approves) a particular transaction type at the first website.

### The user is given an approved access token (notice it’s no longer a request token).

### The user gives the approved access token to the first website.

### The first website gives the access token to the second website as proof of authentication on behalf of the user.

### The second website lets the first website access their site on behalf of the user.

### The user sees a successfully completed transaction occurring.

### OAuth is not the first authentication/authorization system to work this way on behalf of the end-user.

## Authorization and Authentication 

## What is the difference between authorization and authentication?

authentication is the process of verifying who a user is, while authorization is the process of verifying what they have access to.

## What is Authorization Code Flow?

which exchanges an Authorization Code for a token. 

## What is Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)?

is to follow our Native Quickstarts or follow our Single-Page Quickstarts.

## What is Implicit Flow with Form Post?

mplicit Flow with Form Post flow uses OIDC to implement web sign-in that is very similar to the way SAML and WS-Federation operates. The web app requests and obtains tokens through the front channel, without the need for secrets or extra backend calls.

## What is Client Credentials Flow?

machine-to-machine (M2M) applications, such as CLIs, daemons, or services running on your back-end, the system authenticates and authorizes the app rather than a user

## What is Device Authorization Flow?

 input-constrained devices that connect to the internet, rather than authenticate the user directly, the device asks the user to go to a link on their computer or smartphone and authorize the device.

## What is Resource Owner Password Flow?

users provide credentials (username and password), typically using an interactive form. The Resource Owner Password Flow should only be used when redirect-based flows (like the Authorization Code Flow) cannot be used.
