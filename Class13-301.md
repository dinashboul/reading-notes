## What's the relationship between REST and CRUD?

CRUD and REST, two prominent concepts in the API industry, are often confused. Whereas REST is one of the most popular design styles for web APIs (among other applications), CRUD is simply an acronym used to refer to four basic operations that can be performed on database applications: Create, Read, Update, and Delete.

## If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?

### Client-Server: The client and server act independently.

### Stateless: The server does not record the state of the client.

### Cacheable: The server marks whether data is cacheable.

### Uniform Interface: The client and server interact in a uniform and predictable way. An important aspect of this is that the server exposes resources.

### Layered System: The application behaves the same regardless of any intermediaries between the client and server.
